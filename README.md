The Task:

You are to create a simple react app with this dockerfile.
Write a script that accepts a source code with Dockerfile (in zip, repository link, etc), builds an image using Cloud Build/Github actions REST API (should be triggered via API), and returns the container artifact URL.

First thing is to understand what I need to do and the steps to take.
In Summary, the task involves creating a simple React app along with a Dockerfile and writing a script that performs the below tasks:
POV: The script automates the process of building a Docker image from the provided source code and Dockerfile, using either the Cloud Build or GitHub Actions API. The ultimate goal is to obtain the URL where the built Docker image is stored for further use or deployment.
1.	Accepts source code along with a Dockerfile. 
2.	Uses the Cloud Build or GitHub Actions REST API to trigger the build process. 
3.	The script should orchestrate the building of a Docker image using the provided source code and Dockerfile.
4.	After the build is complete, the script should retrieve the container artifact URL. This URL would typically point to the location where the built Docker image is stored, such as a container registry.
After I have successfully grasped the concept of the task, I know the next thing is to get the steps to follow to get it done.
